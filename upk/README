This app is a standalone HTML5 app that can be 
dropped into the doc root of any web server.

The upk.json file included is a snapshot of the 
Pre-K facilities data for development use only.

In production the Pre-K facilities data is servered
by GeoServer as http://maps.nyc.gov/upk/upk.json.
This data may be modified and is cached at a CDN daily.

The project will ultimately be converted to a Gradle
project and include a build for minifying scripts and 
css files.
