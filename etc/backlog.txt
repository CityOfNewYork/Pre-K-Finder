one chareter school in bx doesnt size its 
popup correctly "Academic Leadership Charter School"

"Please contact site for more information" is not a 
valid URL for the WEB_SITE column of the upk data... 
use a default doe url or null

/geoserver/wfs?request=GetFeature&version=1.1.0&typeName=doe:UPK&outputFormat=csv

new oracle table to match new data - 
or maybe just leave oracle and geoserver out of the equation and deploy csv since DOE
is just using excel anyway

extend oracle table to incl constraints and triggers, etc so that DOE can use access/odbc to
update dev db and data integrity is maintained

move date_rules.js to oracle if we accomplish above
